The UnCrazed format (uncrz)

 - Files carry the extention .uncrz, and can cointain animation and model data

Model Format

 - A Model is a collection of segments and sections
 - A Model WILL have a single vertex buffer, index buffer, and trans vector
 - A Model SHOULD NOT carry no information about run-time orientation (see UNCRZ_obj)

 - A Segment WILL carry transform details
 - When drawn, a Segment WILL pass a transformed matrix to it's subsets

 - A Section WILL carry all the rendering details (shader, texture, technique)

Model File Format

 - mdl <name>		inidcates a new model is starting
 - end mdl		finishes off the current model
 - seg <name>		indicates a new segment is starting
 - end seg		finishes off the current segment
 - sec <name>		indicates a new section is starting
 - end sec		finishes off the current section

 - mannormals		indicates that a model will use manual normals
 - vertex <format>	WILL be set at start of model definition - inidcates the vertex format the model uses
 - offset <x> <y> <z>	sets the offset of the current segment
 - rotation <x> <y> <z>	sets the rotation of the current segment
 - v <format data>	creates a new vertex - WILL be inside a segment
 - f <i0> <i1> <i2>	stores the given indicies - WILL be inside a section
 - shader_dx9 <fname>	indicates the DirectX 9 shader file the section is to use
 - shader_ogl3 <fname>	indicates the OpenGL3 shader file the section is to use
 - colmod <r> <g> <b>	sets the colour modification for the section
 - technique <name>	indicates the shader technique the section will use
 - texture <fname>	sets the texture the section will use

 - ioff	<name>		marks an index for future refernce by <ioffName>+offset

Animation Format

 - An Animation WILL contain a collection of Flows, but no runtime information (ie. progress in animation execution)
 - A Flow WILL contain a set of Motions
 - A Flow WILL contain a start progress to start the flow from (ie. 10 frames in from Motion 3)
 - Motions are a collection of instructions, who are carried out a given number of times (frames)
 - An Insutrction describes some sort of geometrical or colourful transformation to a specific Segment or Section in a Model structure

Animation File Format

 - anim <name>		inidcates a new anim is starting
 - end anim		finishes off the current anim
 - flow <name>		inidcates a new flow is starting
 - end flow		finishes off the current flow
 - motion <name>	inidcates a new motion is starting
 - end motion		finishes off the current motion

 - model <name>		indicates the name of the model the anim refers to
 - start <motion> <frame>	sets the start motion/frame of a flow
 - duration <frames>	sets the duration of the current motion
 - a <type> <seg/sec name> <data>	creates a new Instruction

Notes:

 - A model WILL be defined and loaded before an animation - the animation will crawl the model in order to improve performance
 - Flows are, as such, run in paralled in an animation
